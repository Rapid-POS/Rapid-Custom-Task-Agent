Below is a quick outline of the video along with timestamps for easy reference:

#### 1. Overview of Rapid Automated Reporting (00:06–00:22)  
- Purpose: Automate Counterpoint reports so they are emailed to you on a schedule  
- Benefit: Reports automatically arrive in your inbox exactly when you need them 

#### 2. Saving Report Parameters in Counterpoint (00:22–01:27)  
- Open the Counterpoint report you frequently run  
  - Example: Flash Sales Report for month-to-date (MTD) sales  
- Apply all filters as you normally would  
- Go to **Options → Save parameters**  
- Enter a clear name for the saved parameters  
  - Example: `MTD Flash Sales`  
- Check the **`Public`** checkbox so the parameters are available to Rapid Automated Reporting  
- If you already have saved parameters, edit them and confirm that **`Public`** is checked  

#### 3. Opening the Rapid Automated Reporting Tool (01:27–01:45)  
- From the **Home** screen in Counterpoint:  
  - Navigate to the **Rapid custom task agent**  
  - Open the folder and select the **Rapid Automated Reporting** tile  

#### 4. Configuring Email Host Settings (01:45–02:14)  
- In the Email Host section, enter your email server information  
  - Examples: Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook, or your business email domain  
- (Optional) Enter a **CC Email Address List**  
  - All reports that use this email host can also send copies to these addresses  

#### 5. Setting Up Report Details and Recipients (02:14–04:03)  
- **Enabled**  
  - Check this box to turn automated sending on  
- **Form Class**  
  - Choose the report type that matches the Counterpoint report  
  - Example: `Flash Sales Report`  
- **User**  
  - Enter `*` (asterisk) to allow the report to run for all users  
- **Report Parameters**  
  - Use the lookup to select the saved parameters from Step 2  
  - Example: `MTD Flash Sales`  
- **Email Information**  
  - **To:** Primary recipient email address  
    - Example: `george@business.com`  
  - **CC:** Additional recipients (optional)  
    - Separate addresses with commas or semicolons  
  - **Subject:** Clear email subject line  
    - Example: `MTD Sales Report`  
  - **Body:** Optional message in the email body  
    - Example: `Your report for today.`  

#### 6. Scheduling When the Report Runs (04:03–05:32)  
- In the **Occurs** field, select how often the report should run:  
  - Daily  
  - Weekly  
  - Monthly  
- Complete the matching schedule section:  
  - For **Daily**: specify how often it runs each day or every few days  
  - For **Weekly**: specify how many weeks between runs and which day or days of the week  
  - For **Monthly**: specify the day of the month or pattern (for example, first Sunday)  
- In the **Sends** section, define the time of day the report is emailed:  
  - Send once at a specific time  
  - Or send multiple times within a time window (useful for time-sensitive data such as drawer readings)  

#### 7. Saving and Managing Automated Reports (05:32–05:55)  
- Click the **Save** icon to save the configuration  
- A new entry appears in the Rapid Automated Reporting list for that email host  
- You can return to this list to:  
  - Edit an existing automated report  
  - Disable a report if you no longer want it to run  

#### 8. Scheduling Tips and Best Practices (05:55–06:19)  
- Report accuracy depends on both the parameters and the timing of the schedule  
  - For example, for a week-to-date report, schedule it to run after all drawers and related activity have been posted
